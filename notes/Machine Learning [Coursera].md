# Machine Learning [Coursera]

ML Examples

* Data mining
  * Web click data
  * Medical
  * Biology
  * Engineering

* Things you cant a program for
  * Hand writing recognition
  * NLP
  * Computer vision

* Self customizing programs

* Understanding human learning

## What machine learning

* Arthur samuel checkers playing program

* Definition : The computer program is said to learn form expirience E with respesct to task T and some performance P, if its performance on T as measured by P, improved with expirience E

* Main types are supervised learning and unsuperised learning

* Other are reinforcement learning and recommender systems


## Supervised learning

* Given data and machine comes up with an algorithm
* Regression : Predict continous valued output.
* Classfication: Predict the output

## Unsupervised learning

* Clustering

## Model

* m = number of training examples 
* x's = input variables or features
* y's = output variable or target value
* (x, y) =  single training example
* $x^{(i)}, y^{(i)}$ = ith training example
