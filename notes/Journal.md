* Function UI

  [https://engineering.blogfoster.com/the-functional-approach-to-ui/](https://engineering.blogfoster.com/the-functional-approach-to-ui/)

  * `UI = F(S);` : Takes in a state and returns a UI to render
  * In react component takes in properties as input and returns a mark up.
  * To make the state changes predictable, we can make a change immumtable.
  * React allows you to treat the UI as a function of the state, Redux allows you to manage that state in a predictable way. React-Redux binding connects React   component to Redux state, and every time it changes, component gets new state and UI re-rendering triggers.
